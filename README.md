# CP1404 Assignment 2 - Song List 2.0 by Haotian Liu

A Python project with GUI and Console programs that (re)use classes to manage a list of songs to learn.

# Project Reflection

## 1. How long did the entire project (assignment 2) take you?
It took me about a month to complete this project. This time period included everything from project planning, coding to final testing and debugging.

## 2. What are you most satisfied with?
The most satisfying part of my project was successfully building a complete GUI application based on Kivy. Starting from scratch, I learnt how to leverage the Kivy framework and was able to implement a user-friendly interface to manage the song list.

## 3. What are you least satisfied with?
What I'm not so happy with are certain aspects of the interface design. Although functional, I feel that the user interface could be more intuitive and appealing. Also, I think certain parts of the code could be further optimised to improve performance.

## 4. What worked well in your development process?
Using Python classes to organise and manage data has performed very effectively in my development. It makes the code more modular and maintainable. In addition, regular code reviews and tests have helped me find and fix problems in a timely manner.

## 5. What about your process could be improved the next time you do a project like this?
Next time I will focus more on the pre-planning phase, especially on interface design and user experience.

## 6. Describe what learning resources you used and how you used them.
I mainly used the official Kivy documentation to learn the basics of the framework. In addition, I referred to some online tutorials and community forums to solve specific programming challenges. I also looked through some books on advanced programming in Python to improve my programming skills.

## 7. Describe the main challenges or obstacles you faced and how you overcame them.
The main challenge I faced was learning and mastering the Kivy framework. To overcome this challenge, I invested a lot of time in reading documentation and practice.

## 8. Briefly describe your experience using classes and if/how they improved your code.
Using classes has greatly improved the structure of my code. It has made my application more modular, making the code easy to understand and maintain. The encapsulated nature of classes has also helped me manage data and functionality more efficiently, which has improved overall code quality and maintainability.
